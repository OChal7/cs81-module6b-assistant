1. What made your assistant “personal” to you?
The fact i was able to update what specific tasks I had whcih corelated to the tasks I had to complete over this weekend made it feel more personal to me.

2. What challenges did you face using this?
Understanding how this. refers to the object in each method took some time to understand.  I took me a while to remember I needed to call methods on the rigth instance. 
For the line: console.log(`You have ${jarvis.tasks.length} tasks left.`); I innitially typed in tasks.length but figured out I needed jarvis.tasks.length to refer to the proper object.

3. Which method would you improve or expand?
I would expand reportMood() to make it so that depending on the amount of tasks finished it would change to differnt answers (ie 0tasks = motivated, 2-3tasks finished = tired, all tasks finished = accomplished)
